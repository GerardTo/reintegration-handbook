## Key Messages
```tip
1. Mainstreaming reintegration considerations into relevant development and sectoral policies and strategies at the national and local levels can provide wider institutional support for reintegration processes and identify synergies with other sectors.
1. Building capacity and strengthening systems at the structural level allows for greater ownership, sustainability and impact of reintegration programming at the individual and community levels.
1. Engagement and coordination of relevant actors is necessary for increasing effectiveness of reintegration initiatives. This coordination should strategically engage all involved actors in the host country and the country of origin.
1. Setting up clear and coherent international cooperation systems helps all actors understand their role. It facilitates the standardization of processes and procedures for the benefit of returnees, their communities and their countries of origin.

## Introduction

Reintegration assistance at the structural level works towards creating the overall political, institutional, economic and social conditions for sustainable reintegration programming. Strengthening reintegration at the structural level requires the engagement and capacity-building of key stakeholders, strengthening or creating coordination mechanisms, developing an appropriate international cooperation system and mainstreaming reintegration considerations into relevant national and local policies and strategies. Structural reintegration support should start at the onset of reintegration assistance programmes to establish the overall conditions for sustainable reintegration. Attention to the structural aspects of reintegration should continue as long as assistance is provided. Attention to the overall political, institutional, economic and social conditions for sustainable reintegration is particularly important in countries with high numbers of returns.

Structural factors that affect reintegration are related to the political, economic and social conditions at the local, national and international level. They influence how sustainable reintegration strategies should be conceived and the types of partnerships that should be mobilized to support individual returnees and their communities. Conditions such as efficient coordination mechanisms, returnee-oriented policies and strategies, and the capacity and engagement of relevant actors in origin and host countries all affect a returnee’s ability to reintegrate successfully.

The number and scale of structural interventions in a reintegration programme depends on existing capacities in the country of origin and the needs of returnees and communities. Where the number or needs of returnees is limited or well-established social services are available, structural-level interventions could focus on incorporating returnees into existing structures.

However, in countries of origin where capacities and infrastructure are not adequate to provide returnees and the local population with the level of services needed for sustainable reintegration, policy, technical and material support (to public institutions, the private sector and civil society) may be necessary. Existing structural capacities and returnee and community needs can be identified during the initial context, individual and community assessments (see sections 1.4.2, 2.2 and 3.2).

This module provides guidance on strengthening local, national and the international systems of cooperation, governance, coordination and service provision that underpin the delivery of reintegration assistance. It covers building strategic engagement, capacity and ownership of relevant actors; developing and strengthening coordination frameworks; establishing or identifying effective models for international cooperation and strengthening policy frameworks and strategies to support sustainable reintegration.

## Stakeholder engagement, capacity-building and ownership
Working in close partnership with key actors and organizations at all levels contributes to the sustainability of reintegration programmes. It also reinforces national and local ownership of reintegration initiatives. Strategically engaging reintegration stakeholders and developing their capacities improves effectiveness of activities and promotes the continuity of reintegration interventions beyond programme implementation. Strong coordination mechanisms at the international, national and local levels are also crucial for sustainable reintegration. These structural-level interventions should be considered in all reintegration programmes, starting early in the planning phase and continuing throughout programme implementation.

To strengthen the capacities for sustainable reintegration locally and nationally, structural initiatives should reflect the needs and priorities identified by government and civil society in countries of origin. These types of interventions can include:

Engaging and reinforcing local and national capacities to deliver reintegration-related services through technical and institutional support;
Reinforcing the fulfilment of rights for returnees and non-migrant populations alike through quality services in such essential areas as education and training, health and well-being, psychosocial support, employment and housing;
Increasing sustainability of reintegration interventions by fostering their ownership by local and national authorities and other stakeholders in countries of origin; and
Strengthening policy frameworks to promote well-managed migration (see section 4.3).
Reflecting these priorities, it is important to engage with identified stakeholders through a tailored engagement approach with the aim to develop joint strategies to address reintegration needs at the individual, community and structural levels.

This chapter presents a detailed overview of essential work with reintegration stakeholders.

### Stakeholder engagement
Following the stakeholder mapping carried out during the design stage (see section 1.4.2) and based on the reintegration programme’s strategic objectives and the selection of relevant stakeholders, the lead reintegration organization needs to define an engagement and communications strategy for the various groups of  mapped stakeholders. Engagement strategies are descriptions of how a given stakeholder is approached and how relationships are managed over time. The strategy needs to be tailored to stakeholders’ specific profiles as well as to their expected role in the programme. In particular, engaging with local authorities at an early stage is crucial, considering their in-depth knowledge of local services and their direct link to returnees and their communities.
Engagement strategies can be classified into the following three categories, according to stakeholder level of interest in the reintegration programme and their level of influence over the reintegration process.

- **Inform** (low priority): For stakeholders with low levels of influence and little interest in the implementation of the reintegration programme and who may be interested only in obtaining information about what is. happening, the lead reintegration organization should simply provide periodic information on its objectives. and activities, such as through awareness-raising campaigns, publications or reports.
- **Communicate** (medium priority): For stakeholders with either a higher level of influence or high level of interest in reintegration programming, the lead reintegration organization should engage in twoway. communication to help them value the engagement. Their targeted involvement in reintegration activities should be sought. Communication can be coordination (with partners that can provide certain. reintegration services), or invitations to planning sessions (such as for community-based activities) or. prioritized access to information on the reintegration programme.
- **Manage closely** (high priority): For stakeholders that can exert a large influence on the reintegration process and who also have a high interest in engaging with the lead reintegration organization, a tailored engagement approach should be developed. This can take the form of a memorandum of understanding, a joint local development project with a local municipality, a public-private partnership with relevant private actors, research collaboration with a local university or periodic meetings to align processes and identify synergies.

When developing stakeholder engagement plans, it is important to anticipate stakeholders’ perceptions of the reintegration programme.

An overview of different stakeholder categories and their possible functions is provided below:

|Stakeholder|Relevance|Possible functions|
|-|-|-|
|- [National Authorities](test)|National-level authorities....|Adapt the national legislative framework|
|Ministries|||
|Government Agencies|||


```warning
Stakeholders may have competing priorities or limited resources and as a result may not be able to engage as envisioned by the lead reintegration organization. However, this could change over time. It is therefore important to remain in contact with stakeholders, even if they are initially unable to support reintegration programming. Their interest in engagement can shift over time.
